<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>The file path: <code>/usr/include/inttypes.h</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>inttypes.h</code> file is a C header file that is part of the C standard
library and API. It was added with the 1999 version of the ISO C
standard (known as C99). It includes the stdint.h header and defines a
number of macros for using it with the <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> family of
functions, as well as functions for working with the intmax<sub>t</sub> type.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li id="sec-1-2-1">Naming Convention and format specifiers for Macros<br/>
The macros defined in inttypes.h follow a regular pattern to simplify
usage. The pattern followed is as follows:

<ul>
<li>First three characters
<ul>
<li>PRI for output format (printf, fwprintf, wprintf, etc.)
</li>
<li>SCN for input format (scanf, fwscanf, etc.)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Fourth character
<ul>
<li>d for decimal formatting
</li>
<li>x for hexadecimal formatting
</li>
<li>o for octal formatting
</li>
<li>u for unsigned int formatting
</li>
<li>i for integer formatting
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Remaining Characters
<ul>
<li>N for N bit size assignment to the data type (Eg. 32 for 32-bit size for integer, 16 for 16-bit size for unsigned int and so on)
</li>
<li>PTR for pointer
</li>
<li>MAX for maximum supported bit size
</li>
<li>FAST, whose meaning is not clearly defined and is left to the implementation to decide what is meant by a "fast" integer data type.

different rules for static variables versus static functions.

<p>
The difference is case (2); where functions do pick up a previous
linkage even without "extern", objects don't.

<div id="outline-container-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4">Q1.20b What does it mean for a function parameter to be const? What do the two const's in</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">

<p><code>int f(const * const p)</code> mean?
</p>
<p>
The first of the two const's is perfectly appropriate and quite
useful; many functions declare parameters which are pointers to const
data, and doing so documents (and tends to enforce) the function's
promise that it won't modify the pointed-to data in the caller. The
second const, on the other hand, is almost useless; all it says is
that the function won't alter its own copy of the pointer, even though
it wouldn't cause the caller or the function any problems if it did,
nor is this anything the caller should care about in any case. The
situation is the same as if a function declared an ordinary
(non-pointer) parameter as const:
</p>
<p>
        <code>int f2(const int x)</code>
This says that nowhere in the body of f2() will the function assign a
different value to x. 
</p></div>

<h3 id="sec-1-5">Q1.21  How do I construct declarations of complicated types such as ``array of N pointers to functions returning pointers to functions returning pointers to char'', or figure out what similarly complicated declarations mean?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">


<ol>
<li><code>char *(*(*a[N])())();</code>

<p>Build the declaration up incrementally, using <code>typedefs</code>:
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #00ffff;">typedef</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span> *<span style="color: #98fb98;">pc</span>;       <span style="color: #ff7f24;">/* </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">pointer to char </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">*/</span>

</pre>

<p>
Use the <b>cdecl</b> program, which turns English into C and vice versa.
You provide a longhand description of the type you want, and cdecl
responds with the equivalent C declaration:
</p>


<pre class="src src-sh">cdecl&gt; declare a as array of pointer to <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">returning</span>
        pointer to <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">returning</span> pointer to char

char *(*(*a[])())()
</pre>

<p>
 <b>cdecl</b> can also explain complicated declarations (you give it a
complicated declaration and it responds with an English description),
help with casts, and indicate which set of parentheses the parameters
go in (for complicated function definitions, like the one above).
</p>
<p>
One way to make sense of complicated C declarations is by reading them
``inside out,'' remembering that [] and () bind more tightly than *.
For example, given
</p>
<p>
        <code>char *(*pfpc)();</code>
</p>
<p>
we can see that pfpc is a pointer (the inner *) to a function (the ())
to a pointer (the outer *) to char. When we later use pfpc, the
expression *(*pfpc)() (the value pointed to by the return value of a
function pointed to by pfpc) will be a char.
</p>
<p>
Another way of analyzing these declarations is to decompose the
declarator while composing the description, maintaining the
``declaration mimics use'' relationship: 
</p>


<pre class="src src-c">*(*pfpc)()      is a    <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span>
(*<span style="color: #87cefa;">pfpc</span>)()       is a    pointer to <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span>
(*<span style="color: #eedd82;">pfpc</span>) is a    function returning pointer to <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span>
<span style="color: #eedd82;">pfpc</span>    is a    pointer to function returning pointer to <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span>
</pre>

<p>
If you'd like to make things clearer when declaring complicated types
        like these, you can make the analysis explicit by using a
        chain of typedefs as in option 2 above.

David Anderson's <a href="http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html">``Clockwise/Spiral Rule''</a>
</p>
<p>
There is a technique known as the ``Clockwise/Spiral Rule'' which
enables any C programmer to parse in their head any C declaration!
</p>
<p>
There are three simple steps to follow:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting with the unknown element, move in a spiral/clockwise direction; when ecountering the following elements replace them with the corresponding english statements:
</li>
</ol>

<p>[X] or []
=&gt; Array X size of&hellip; or Array undefined size of&hellip;
(type1, type2)
<code>&gt; function passing type1 and type2 returning... =*</code>
=&gt; pointer(s) to&hellip;
</p><ol>
<li>Keep doing this in a spiral/clockwise direction until all tokens have been covered.
</li>
<li>Always resolve anything in parenthesis first!
 <b>Example #1: Simple declaration</b>

<p>
Question we ask ourselves: What is `signal'?
</p>
<p>
Notice that signal is inside parenthesis, so we must resolve this first!
</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving in a clockwise direction we see `(' so we have&hellip;
 ``signal is a function passing an int and a&hellip;
</li>
<li>Hmmm, we can use this same rule on `fp', so&hellip; What is fp? fp is also inside parenthesis so continuing we see an `*', so&hellip;
 fp is a pointer to&hellip;
</li>
<li>Continue in a spiral clockwise direction and we get to `(', so&hellip;
 ``fp is a pointer to a function passing int returning&hellip;''
</li>
<li>Now we continue out of the function parenthesis and we see void, so&hellip;
 ``fp is a pointer to a function passing int returning nothing (void)''
</li>
<li>We have finished with fp so let's catch up with `signal', we now have&hellip;
 ``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an int returning nothing (void) returning&hellip;
</li>
<li>We are still inside parenthesis so the next character seen is a `*', so&hellip;
 ``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an int returning nothing (void) returning a pointer to&hellip;
</li>
<li>We have now resolved the items within parenthesis, so continuing clockwise, we then see another `(', so&hellip;
 ``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an int returning nothing (void) returning a pointer to a function passing an int returning&hellip;
</li>
<li>Finally we continue and the only thing left is the word `void', so the final complete definition for signal is:
 ``signal is a function passing an int and a pointer to a function passing an int returning nothing (void) returning a pointer to a function passing an int returning nothing (void)''
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The same rule is applied for const and volatile. For Example:
</p>
<p>
        <code>const char *chptr;</code>
</p><ul>
<li>Now, what is chptr??
</li>
</ul>

<p>``chptr is a pointer to a char constant''
</p>
<p>
How about this one:
</p>
<p>
        char * const chptr;
</p><ul>
<li>Now, what is chptr??
</li>
</ul>

<p>``chptr is a constant pointer to char''
</p>
<p>
Finally:
</p>
<p>
        volatile char * const chptr;
</p><ul>
<li>Now, what is chptr??
</li>
</ul>

<p>``chptr is a constant pointer to a char volatile.''

<h3 id="sec-1-6">Q1.29 How can I determine which identifiers are safe for me to use and which are reserved?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">

<p>What do the above rules really mean? If you want to be on the safe side:
</p>
<p>
1,2. Don't give anything a name with a leading underscore.
</p><ol>
<li>Don't give anything a name which is already a standard macro (including the ``future directions'' patterns).
</li>
<li>Don't give any functions or global variables names which are already taken by functions or variables in the standard library, or which match any of the ``future directions'' patterns. (Strictly speaking, ``matching'' means matching in the first six characters, without regard to case; see question 11.27.)
</li>
<li>Don't redefine standard typedef or tag names.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
In fact, the preceding subparagraphs are overly conservative. If you wish, you may remember the following exceptions:
</p>
<p>
1,2. You may use identifiers consisting of an underscore followed by a digit or lower case letter for labels and structure/union members.
1,2. You may use identifiers consisting of an underscore followed by a digit or lower case letter at function, block, or prototype scope.
</p><ol>
<li>You may use names matching standard macro names if you don't #include any header files which #define them.
</li>
<li>You may use names of standard library routines as static or local variables (strictly speaking, as identifiers with internal or no linkage).
</li>
<li>You may use standard typedef and tag names if you don't #include any header files which declare them.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
However, before making use of any of these exceptions, recognize that
some of them are pretty risky (especially exceptions 3 and 5, since
you could accidentally #include the relevant header file at a later
time, perhaps through a chain of nested #include files), and others
(especially the ones labeled 1,2) represent sort of a ``no man's
land'' between the user namespaces and the namespaces reserved to the
implementation.

};
</pre>

<p>
and then did some tricky allocation to make the <code>namestr</code> array act like
        it had several elements, with the number recorded by namelen.
        How does this work? Is it legal or portable?
</p>
<p>
An implementation of the technique might look something like this:
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #b0c4de;">#include</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">#include</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">&lt;string.h&gt;</span>

{
        <span style="color: #00ffff;">struct</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">name</span> *<span style="color: #eedd82;">ret</span> =
                malloc(<span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #00ffff;">struct</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">name</span>)-1 + strlen(newname)+1);

                ret-&gt;namelen = strlen(newname);
                strcpy(ret-&gt;namestr, newname);
        }

        <span style="color: #00ffff;">return</span> ret;
}
</pre>

<p>
This function allocates an instance of the name structure with the
size adjusted so that the namestr field can hold the requested name
(not just one character, as the structure declaration would suggest).
</p>
<p>
Another possibility is to declare the variable-size element very
large, rather than very small. The above example could be rewritten
like this:
</p>



<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #b0c4de;">#include</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>

        <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">namelen</span>;
        <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">namestr</span>[MAXSIZE];
};

<span style="color: #00ffff;">struct</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">name</span> *<span style="color: #87cefa;">makename</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span> *<span style="color: #eedd82;">newname</span>)
{
        <span style="color: #00ffff;">struct</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">name</span> *<span style="color: #eedd82;">ret</span> =
                malloc(<span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #00ffff;">struct</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">name</span>)-MAXSIZE+strlen(newname)+1);
                                                                <span style="color: #ff7f24;">/* </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">+1 for \0 </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">*/</span>
        <span style="color: #00ffff;">if</span>(ret != <span style="color: #7fffd4;">NULL</span>) {
                ret-&gt;namelen = strlen(newname);

        }

        <span style="color: #00ffff;">return</span> ret;
}
</pre>

<p>
where MAXSIZE is larger than any name which will be stored. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, to be truly safe, the right thing to do is use a character
pointer instead of an array:
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #b0c4de;">#include</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>

        <span style="color: #00ffff;">if</span>(ret != <span style="color: #7fffd4;">NULL</span>) {
                ret-&gt;namelen = strlen(newname);
                ret-&gt;namep = malloc(ret-&gt;namelen + 1);
                <span style="color: #00ffff;">if</span>(ret-&gt;namep == <span style="color: #7fffd4;">NULL</span>) {
                        free(ret);
                        <span style="color: #00ffff;">return</span> <span style="color: #7fffd4;">NULL</span>;

        <span style="color: #00ffff;">return</span> ret;
}

<p>
(Obviously, the ``convenience'' of having the length and the string
stored in the same block of memory has now been lost, and freeing
instances of this structure will require two calls to free; see
question 7.23.)

<p>C99 introduces ``compound literals'', one form of which provides for structure constants. For example, to pass a constant coordinate pair to a hypothetical plotpoint function which expects a struct point, you can call

<p>
        <code>plotpoint((struct point){1, 2});</code>

<p>It is relatively straightforward to write a structure out using fwrite:
</p>
<p>
        <code>fwrite(&amp;somestruct, sizeof somestruct, 1, fp);</code>
and a corresponding <code>fread</code> invocation can read it back in. What happens
here is that <code>fwrite</code> receives a pointer to the structure, and writes
(or <code>fread</code> correspondingly reads) the memory image of the structure as
a stream of bytes. The sizeof operator determines how many bytes the
structure occupies.
</p>
<p>
However, data files written as memory images in this way will not be
portable, particularly if they contain floating-point fields or
pointers. The memory layout of structures is machine and compiler
dependent. Different compilers may use different amounts of padding
(see question 2.12), and the sizes and byte orders of fundamental
types vary across machines.

<p>
For the floating-point number -1.0, this program prints:
</p>
<p>
<code>sign = negative, biased exponent = 127, mantissa = 0</code>
</p>
<p>
Since the sign of the floating-point number is negative, the value of
the sign bit is 1. Since the exponent is actual 0, in unsigned
exponent format, it is represented as 127, and hence that value is
printed. The mantissa in this case is 0, and hence it is printed as it
is.

It is from 0 to -1 (not 0 and 1, which is a common mistake). Remember
the formula for finding out the range of signed integers: 2<sup>(n-1)</sup> to
2<sup>(n-1)</sup>-1 where N is the number of bits. For example, if N is 8 (number
of bits in a byte), i.e., the range of a signed integer of size 8 is
-2<sup>(8-1)</sup> to 2<sup>(8-1)</sup>-1, which is -128 to +127. Now, when N is 1, i.e.,
the range of a signed integer of size 1, it is -2<sup>(1-1)</sup> to 2<sup>(1-1)</sup>-1,
which is -1 to 0!

Operator precedence and explicit parentheses impose only a partial ordering on the evaluation of an expression. In the expression

although we know that the multiplication will happen before the addition, there is no telling which of the three functions will be called first. In other words, precedence only partially specifies order of evaluation, where ``partially'' emphatically does not cover evaluation of operands.
Parentheses tell the compiler which operands go with which operators; they do not force the compiler to evaluate everything within the parentheses first. Adding explicit parentheses to the above expression to make it

</p>
<p>
Under C's integral promotion rules, the multiplication is carried out
using int arithmetic, and the result may overflow or be truncated
before being promoted and assigned to the long int left-hand side. Use
an explicit cast on at least one of the operands to force long
arithmetic:
</p>
<p>
        <code>long int c = (long int)a * b;</code>
</p>
<p>
or perhaps
</p>
<p>
        <code>long int c = (long int)a * (long int)b;</code>
</p>
<p>
(both forms are equivalent).
Notice that the expression <code>(long int)(a * b)</code> would not have the
desired effect. An explicit cast of this form (i.e. applied to the
result of the multiplication) is equivalent to the implicit conversion
which would occur anyway when the value is assigned to the long int
left-hand side, and like the implicit conversion, it happens too late,
after the damage has been done.

<div id="outline-container-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4">Q3.19 What's the difference between the ``unsigned preserving'' and ``value preserving'' rules?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">

<p>These rules concern the behavior when an unsigned type must be
promoted to a ``larger'' type. Should it be promoted to a larger
signed or unsigned type? (To foreshadow the answer, it may depend on
whether the larger type is truly larger.)
</p>
<p>
Under the unsigned preserving (also called ``sign preserving'') rules,
the promoted type is always unsigned. This rule has the virtue of
simplicity, but it can lead to surprises (see the first example
below).
</p>
<p>
Under the value preserving rules, the conversion depends on the actual
sizes of the original and promoted types. If the promoted type is
truly larger&ndash;which means that it can represent all the values of the
original, unsigned type as signed values&ndash;then the promoted type is
signed. If the two types are actually the same size, then the promoted
type is unsigned (as for the unsigned preserving rules).
</p>
<p>
Since the actual sizes of the types are used in making the
determination, the results will vary from machine to machine. On some
machines, short int is smaller than int, but on some machines, they're
the same size. On some machines, int is smaller than long int, but on
some machines, they're the same size.
</p>
<p>
In practice, the difference between the unsigned and value preserving
rules matters most often when one operand of a binary operator is (or
promotes to) int and the other one might, depending on the promotion
rules, be either int or unsigned int. If one operand is unsigned int,
the other will be converted to that type&ndash;almost certainly causing an
undesired result if its value was negative (again, see the first
example below). When the ANSI C Standard was established, the value
preserving rules were chosen, to reduce the number of cases where
these surprising results occur. (On the other hand, the value
preserving rules also reduce the number of predictable cases, because
portable programs cannot depend on a machine's type sizes and hence
cannot know which way the value preserving rules will fall.)
</p>
<p>
Here is a contrived example showing the sort of surprise that can
occur under the unsigned preserving rules:
</p>



<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">unsigned</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">short</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">us</span> = 10;
<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">i</span> = -5;
<span style="color: #00ffff;">if</span>(i &gt; us)
        printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"whoops!\n"</span>);
</pre>

<p>
The important issue is how the expression <code>i &gt; us</code> is evaluated. Under
        the unsigned preserving rules (and under the value preserving
        rules on a machine where short integers and plain integers are
        the same size), us is promoted to unsigned int. The usual
        integral conversions say that when types unsigned int and int
        meet across a binary operator, both operands are converted to
        unsigned, so i is converted to unsigned int, as well. The old
        value of i, -5, is converted to some large unsigned value
        (65,531 on a 16-bit machine). This converted value is greater
        than 10, so the code prints ``whoops!''
</p>
<p>
Under the value preserving rules, on a machine where plain integers
are larger than short integers, us is converted to a plain int (and
retains its value, 10), and i remains a plain int. The expression is
not true, and the code prints nothing. (To see why the values can be
preserved only when the signed type is larger, remember that a value
like 40,000 can be represented as an unsigned 16-bit integer but not
as a signed one.)
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the value preserving rules do not prevent all
surprises. The example just presented still prints ``whoops'' on a
machine where short and plain integers are the same size. The value
preserving rules may also inject a few surprises of their
own&ndash;consider the code:
</p>



<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">unsigned</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">char</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">uc</span> = 0x80;
<span style="color: #98fb98;">unsigned</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">long</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">ul</span> = 0;
ul |= uc &lt;&lt; 8;
printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"0x%lx\n"</span>, ul);
</pre>

<p>
Before being left-shifted, uc is promoted. Under the unsigned
        preserving rules, it is promoted to an unsigned int, and the
        code goes on to print 0x8000, as expected. Under the value
        preserving rules, however, uc is promoted to a signed int (as
        long as int's are larger than char's, which is usually the
        case). The intermediate result uc &lt;&lt; 8 goes on to meet ul,
        which is unsigned long. The signed, intermediate result must
        therefore be promoted as well, and if int is smaller than
        long, the intermediate result is sign-extended, becoming
        0xffff8000 on a machine with 32-bit longs. On such a machine,
        the code prints 0xffff8000, which is probably not what was
        expected. (On machines where int and long are the same size,
        the code prints 0x8000 under either set of rules.)
</p>
<p>
To avoid surprises (under either set of rules, or due to an unexpected
        change of rules), it's best to avoid mixing signed and
        unsigned types in the same expression, although as the second
        example shows, this rule is not always sufficient. You can
        always use explicit casts to indicate, unambiguously, exactly
        where and how you want conversions performed; see questions
        12.42 and 16.7 for examples. (Some compilers attempt to warn
        you when they detect ambiguous cases or expressions which
        would have behaved differently under the unsigned preserving
        rules, although sometimes these warnings fire too often; see
        also question 3.18.)

 In C, a cast operator does not mean ``pretend these bits have a
 different type, and treat them accordingly''; it is a conversion
 operator, and by definition it yields an rvalue, which cannot be
 assigned to, or incremented with ++. (It is either an accident or a
 deliberate but nonstandard extension if a particular compiler accepts
 expressions such as the above.) Say what you mean: use
</p>
<p>
        <code>p = (char *)((int *)p + 1);</code>

f((<span style="color: #98fb98;">void</span> **)&amp;dp);
</pre>


<p>
Not portably. Code like this may work and is sometimes recommended,
but it relies on all pointer types having the same internal
representation (which is common, but not universal; see question
5.17).
</p>
<p>
There is no generic pointer-to-pointer type in C. <code>void *</code> acts as a
generic pointer only because conversions (if necessary) are applied
automatically when other pointer types are assigned to and from <code>void</code>
*'s; these conversions cannot be performed if an attempt is made to
indirect upon a <code>void **</code> value which points at a pointer type other
than <code>void *</code>. When you make use of a <code>void **</code> pointer value (for
instance, when you use the * operator to access the <code>void *</code> value to
which the void ** points), the compiler has no way of knowing whether
that void * value was once converted from some other pointer type. It
must assume that it is nothing more than a <code>void *</code>; it cannot perform
any implicit conversions.
</p>
<p>
In other words, any <code>void **</code> value you play with must be the address of
an actual <code>void *</code> value somewhere; casts like <code>(void **)&amp;dp</code>, though they
may shut the compiler up, are nonportable (and may not even do what
you want; see also question 13.9). If the pointer that the <code>void **</code>
points to is not a <code>void *</code>, and if it has a different size or
representation than a <code>void *</code>, then the compiler isn't going to be able
to access it correctly.
</p>
<p>
To make the code fragment above work, you'd have to use an
intermediate <code>void *</code> variable:
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">double</span> *<span style="color: #eedd82;">dp</span>;
<span style="color: #98fb98;">void</span> *<span style="color: #eedd82;">vp</span> = dp;
f(&amp;vp);
dp = vp;
</pre>

<p>
The assignments to and from vp give the compiler the opportunity to
perform any conversions, if necessary.
</p>
<p>
Again, the discussion so far assumes that different pointer types
might have different sizes or representations, which is rare today,
but not unheard of. To appreciate the problem with void ** more
clearly, compare the situation to an analogous one involving, say,
types int and double, which probably have different sizes and
certainly have different representations. If we have a function
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">void</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">incme</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">double</span> *<span style="color: #eedd82;">p</span>)
{
        *p += 1;
}
</pre>

<p>
then we can do something like
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">i</span> = 1;
<span style="color: #98fb98;">double</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">d</span> = i;
incme(&amp;d);
i = d;
</pre>

<p>
and <code>i</code> will be incremented by 1. (This is analogous to the correct
void ** code involving the auxiliary vp.) If, on the other hand, we
were to attempt something like
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">i</span> = 1;
incme((<span style="color: #98fb98;">double</span> *)&amp;i);    <span style="color: #ff7f24;">/* </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">WRONG </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">*/</span>

Substituting the trivial pointer expression ``p'' for ``expr'', we have

and this is a comparison context, so the compiler can tell that the

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">

<p> The term ``lvalue'' doesn't quite mean ``something you can assign
 to''; a better definition is ``something that has a location (in
 memory).'' The ANSI/ISO C Standard goes on to define a
 ``modifiable lvalue''; an array is not a modifiable lvalue

<h3 id="sec-6-3">Q6.8 Practically speaking, what is the difference between arrays and pointers?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-3">

<p>An array is a single, preallocated chunk of contiguous elements (all
of the same type), fixed in size and location. A pointer is a
reference to any data element (of a particular type) anywhere. A
pointer must be assigned to point to space allocated elsewhere, but it
can be reassigned (and the space, if derived from malloc, can be
resized) at any time. A pointer can point to an array, and can
simulate (along with malloc) a dynamically allocated array, but a
pointer is a much more general data structure.
</p>
<p>
Due to the so-called equivalence of arrays and pointers, arrays and
pointers often seem interchangeable, and in particular a pointer to a
block of memory assigned by malloc is frequently treated (and can be
referenced using []) exactly as if it were a true array.

<h3 id="sec-6-4">Q6.11 I came across some ``joke'' code containing the ``expression'' 5["abcdef"] . How can this be legal C?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-4">

<p>   Yes, Virginia, array subscripting is commutative in C.  This curious
   fact follows from the pointer definition of array subscripting, namely
   that <code>a[e]</code> is identical to <code>*((a)+(e))</code>, for any two expressions a and e,
   as long as one of them is a pointer expression and one is integral.
   The ``proof'' looks like
</p>


<pre class="src src-c">a[e]
*((a) + (e))    (<span style="color: #98fb98;">by</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">definition</span>)

<p>
This unsuspected commutativity is often mentioned in C texts as if it
were something to be proud of, but it finds no useful application
outside of the Obfuscated C Contest.

<p>
Since strings in C are arrays of char, the expression "abcdef"[ 5] is
perfectly legal, and evaluates to the character 'f'. You can think of
it as a shorthand for

<h3 id="sec-6-5">Q6.13 How do I declare a pointer to an array?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-5">

<p>If you really need to declare a pointer to an entire array, use
something like ``int (*ap)[N];'' where N is the size of the array.
If the size of the array is unknown, N can in principle be omitted,
but the resulting type, ``pointer to array of unknown size,'' is
useless.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example showing the difference between simple pointers and
pointers to arrays. Given the declarations
</p>



<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a1</span>[3] = {0, 1, 2};
<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a2</span>[2][3] = {{3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8}};

</pre>

<p>
you could use the simple pointer-to-int, ip, to access the one-dimensional array a1:
</p>


<pre class="src src-c">        ip = a1;
        printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"%d "</span>, *ip);
        ip++;
        printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"%d\n"</span>, *ip);

        0 1

<p>
An attempt to use a pointer-to-array, ap, on a1:

<pre class="src src-c">ap = &amp;a1;
printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"%d\n"</span>, **ap);
ap++;                           <span style="color: #ff7f24;">/* </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">WRONG </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">*/</span>

</pre>

<p>
would print 0 on the first line and something undefined on the second
(and might crash). The pointer-to-array would only be at all useful in
accessing an array of arrays, such as a2:
</p>



<pre class="src src-c">        ap = a2;
        printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"%d %d\n"</span>, (*ap)[0], (*ap)[1]);
        ap++;           <span style="color: #ff7f24;">/* </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">steps over entire (sub)array </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">*/</span>
        printf(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"%d %d\n"</span>, (*ap)[0], (*ap)[1]);

<h3 id="sec-6-6">Q6.16 How can I dynamically allocate a multidimensional array?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-6">

<p>The traditional solution is to allocate an array [footnote] of
pointers to pointers, and then initialize each pointer to a
dynamically-allocated ``row.'' Here is a two-dimensional example:
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #b0c4de;">#include</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> **<span style="color: #eedd82;">array1</span> = malloc(nrows * <span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> *));
<span style="color: #00ffff;">for</span>(i = 0; i &lt; nrows; i++)
        array1[i] = malloc(ncolumns * <span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span>));
</pre>

<p>
(In real code, of course, all of malloc's return values would be
        checked. You can also use <code>sizeof(*array1)</code> and <code>sizeof(**array1)</code>
        instead of <code>sizeof(int *)</code> and <code>sizeof(int)</code>;)
</p>
<p>
You can keep the array's contents contiguous, at the cost of making
later reallocation of individual rows more difficult, with a bit of
explicit pointer arithmetic:
</p>



<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> **<span style="color: #eedd82;">array2</span> = malloc(nrows * <span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> *));
array2[0] = malloc(nrows * ncolumns * <span style="color: #00ffff;">sizeof</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span>));
<span style="color: #00ffff;">for</span>(i = 1; i &lt; nrows; i++)
        array2[i] = array2[0] + i * ncolumns;
</pre>

<p>
In either case (i.e for array1 or array2), the elements of the dynamic
        array can be accessed with normal-looking array subscripts:
        <code>arrayx[i][j]</code> (for 0 &lt;= i &lt; nrows and 0 &lt;= j &lt; ncolumns). Here
        is a schematic illustration of the layout of array1 and
        array2:
