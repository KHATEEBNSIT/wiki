<h3 id="sec-1-1">The Programming Systems Product</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>Moving down across the horizontal boundary, a program
becomes a programming product. This is a program that can be run,tested, repaired, and extended by anybody. It is usable in many
operating environments, for many sets of data. To become a generally
usable programming product, a program must be written in a
generalized fashion. In particular the range and form of inputs
must be generalized as much as the basic algorithm will reasonably
allow. Then the program must be thoroughly tested, so that it can
be depended upon. This means that a substantial bank of test
cases, exploring the input range and probing its boundaries, must
be prepared, run, and recorded. Finally, promotion of a program
to a programming product requires its thorough documentation, so
that anyone may use it, fix it, and extend it. As a rule of thumb,
I estimate that a programming product costs at least three times as
much as a debugged program with the same function.
</p>
<p>
Moving across the vertical boundary, a program becomes a
component in a programming system. This is a collection of interacting
programs, coordinated in function and disciplined in format,
so that the assemblage constitutes an entire facility for large tasks.
To become a programming system component, a program must be
written so that every input and output conforms in syntax and
semantics with precisely defined interfaces. The program must
also be designed so that it uses only a prescribed budget of resources—
memory space, input-output devices, computer time. Finally,
the program must be tested with other system components,
in all expected combinations. This testing must be extensive, for
the number of cases grows combinatorially. It is time-consuming,
for subtle bugs arise from unexpected interactions of debugged
components. A programming system component costs at least
three times as much as a stand-alone program of the same function.
The cost may be greater if the system has many components.
</p>
<p>
In the lower right-hand corner of Fig. 1.1 stands the programming
systems product. This differs from the simple program in all of
the above ways. It costs nine times as much. But it is the truly
useful object, the intended product of most system programming
efforts.

<h3 id="sec-1-2">The Joys of the Craft</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>First is the sheer joy of making things
</p>
<p>
Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to
other people.
</p>
<p>
Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like
objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in
subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in
from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the
nonrepeating nature of the task.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable
medium.

<h3 id="sec-1-3">The Woes of the Craft</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the
magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of
the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't
work.
</p>
<p>
Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources,
and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the
circumstances of his work, or even its goal.
</p>
<p>
The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding
nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no
exception.
</p>
<p>
Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or
worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach
to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking
more time to find than the first.
</p>
<p>
The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product
over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon
(or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in
hot pursuit of new and better ideas. Already the displacement of
one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time
than for all other causes combined. Why is this cause of disaster
so common?
</p>
<p>
First, our techniques of estimating are poorly developed.
</p>
<p>
Second, our estimating techniques fallaciously confuse effort
with progress, hiding the assumption that men and months are
interchangeable.
</p>
<p>
Third, because we are uncertain of our estimates, software
managers often lack the courteous stubbornness of Antoine's chef.
</p>
<p>
Fourth, schedule progress is poorly monitored.
</p>
<p>
Fifth, when schedule slippage is recognized, the natural (and
traditional) response is to add manpower.
</p>
<p>
For some years I have been successfully using the following
rule of thumb for scheduling a software task:
</p>
<p class="verse">
l/3 planning<br/>
l/6 coding<br/>
l/4 component test and early system test<br/>
l/4 system test, all components in hand.<br/>
</p>


<p>
This differs from conventional scheduling in several important
ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The fraction devoted to planning is larger than normal. Even
</li>
</ol>

<p>so, it is barely enough to produce a detailed and solid specification,
and not enough to include research or exploration of
totally new techniques.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The half of the schedule devoted to debugging of completed
</li>
</ol>

<p>code is much larger than normal.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The part that is easy to estimate, i.e., coding, is given only
</li>
</ol>

<p>one-sixth of the schedule.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Mills's Proposal</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">

<p>Mills proposes that each segment of a large job be tackled
by a team, but that the team be organized like a surgical team
rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each member
cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the
others give him every support that will enhance his effectiveness
and productivity.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon. Mills calls him a chief programmer. He personally
defines the functional and performance specifications, designs the
program, codes it, tests it, and writes its documentation.
</p>
<p>
The copilot. He is the alter ego of the surgeon, able to do any
part of the job, but is less experienced. His main function is to
share in the design as a thinkerrdiscussant, and evaluator. The
surgeon tries ideas on him, but is not bound by his advice. The
copilot often represents his team in discussions of function and
interface with other teams. He knows all the code intimately. He
researches alternative design strategies. He obviously serves as
insurance against disaster to the surgeon. He may even write code,
but he is not responsible for any part of the code.
</p>
<p>
The administrator. The surgeon is boss, and he must have the
last word on personnel, raises, space, and so on, but he must spend
almost none of his time on these matters. Thus he needs a professional
administrator who handles money, people, space, and machines,
and who interfaces with the administrative machinery of
the rest of the organization. Baker suggests that the administrator
has a full-time job only if the project has substantial legal, contractual,
reporting, or financial requirements because of the userproducer
relationship. Otherwise, one administrator can serve two
teams.
</p>
<p>
The editor. The surgeon is responsible for generating the documentation—
for maximum clarity he must write it. This is true of
both external and internal descriptions. The editor, however, takes
the draft or dictated manuscript produced by the surgeon and
criticizes it, reworks it, provides it with references and bibliography,
nurses it through several versions, and oversees the mechanics
of production.
</p>
<p>
Two secretaries. The administrator and the editor will each need
a secretary; the administrator's secretary will handle project correspondence
and non-product files.
</p>
<p>
The program clerk. He is responsible for maintaining all the
technical records of the team in a programming-product library.
The clerk is trained as a secretary and has responsibility for both
machine-readable and human-readable files.
</p>
<p>
The toolsmith. File-editing, text-editing, and interactive debugging
services are now readily available, so that a team will rarely
need its own machine and machine-operating crew. But these
services must be available with unquestionably satisfactory response
and reliability; and the surgeon must be sole judge of the
adequacy of the service available to him. He needs a toolsmith,
responsible for ensuring this adequacy of the basic service and for
constructing, maintaining, and upgrading special tools—mostly
interactive computer services—needed by his team. Each team will
need its own toolsmith, regardless of the excellence and reliability
of any centrally provided service, for his job is to see to the tools
needed or wanted by his surgeon, without regard to any other
team's needs. The tool-builder will often construct specialized
utilities, catalogued procedures, macro libraries.
</p>
<p>
The tester. The surgeon will need a bank of suitable test cases
for testing pieces of his work as he writes it, and then for testing
the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
The language lawyer. By the time Algol came along, people
began to recognize that most computer installations have one or
two people who delight in mastery of the intricacies of a programming
language.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">How It Works</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">

<p>Notice in particular the differences between a team of two
programmers conventionally organized and the surgeon-copilot
team. First, in the conventional team the partners divide the work,
and each is responsible for design and implementation of part of
the work. In the surgical team, the surgeon and copilot are each
cognizant of all of the design and all of the code. This saves the
labor of allocating space, disk accesses, etc. It also ensures the
conceptual integrity of the work.
</p>
<p>
 In the surgical team, there are no
differences of interest, and differences of judgment are settled by
the surgeon unilaterally. These two differences—lack of division
of the problem and the superior-subordinate relationship—make
it possible for the surgical team to act uno animo.

<div id="outline-container-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Conceptual Integrity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">

<p>I will contend that conceptual integrity is the most important
consideration in system design. It is better to have a system omit
certain anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one
set of design ideas, than to have one that contains many good but
independent and uncoordinated ideas.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Achieving Conceptual Integrity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">

<p>Because ease of use is the purpose, this ratio of function to
conceptual complexity is the ultimate test of system design. Nei-
ther function alone nor simplicity alone defines a good design.
</p>
<p>
Simplicity and straightfor-
wardness proceed from conceptual integrity. Every part must re-
flect the same philosophies and the same balancing of desiderata.
Every part must even use the same techniques in syntax and
analogous notions in semantics. Ease of use, then, dictates unity
of design, conceptual integrity.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">Aristocracy and Democracy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">

<p>Conceptual integrity in turn dictates that the design must proceed
from one mind, or from a very small number of agreeing resonant
minds.
</p>
<p>
Schedule pressures, however, dictate that system building
needs many hands. Two techniques are available for resolving this
dilemma. The first is a careful division of labor between architec-
ture and implementation. The second is the new way of structur-
ing programming implementation teams discussed in the previous
chapter.
</p>
<p>
The separation of architectural effort from implementation is
a very powerful way of getting conceptual integrity on very large
projects.
</p>
<p>
By the architecture of a system, I mean the complete and de-
tailed specification of the user interface. For a computer this is the
programming manual. For a compiler it is the language manual. For
a control program it is the manuals for the language or languages
used to invoke its functions. For the entire system it is the union
of the manuals the user must consult to do his entire job.
</p>
<p>
Architecture must be carefully distinguished from implemen-
tation. As Blaauw has said, "Where architecture tells what hap-
pens, implementation tells how it is made to happen."
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-4">What Does the Implementer Do While Waiting?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">

<p>The architecture manager had 10 good men. He asserted that
they could write the specifications and do it right.
</p>
<p>
The control program manager had 150 men. He asserted that
they could prepare the specifications, with the architecture team
coordinating; it would be well-done and practical, and he could do
it on schedule. 
</p>
<p>
As Blaauw points out, the total creative effort involves three
distinct phases: architecture, implementation, and realization. It
turns out that these can in fact be begun in parallel and proceed
simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
In computer design, for example, the implementer can start as
soon as he has relatively vague assumptions about the manual,
somewhat clearer ideas about the technology, and well-defined
cost and performance objectives. He can begin designing data
flows, control sequences, gross packaging concepts, and so on. He
devises or adapts the tools he will need, especially the record-
keeping system, including the design automation system.

<div id="outline-container-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1">Interactive Discipline for the Architect</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">

<p>The architect has two possible answers when confronted with
an estimate that is too high: cut the design or challenge the esti-
mate by suggesting cheaper implementations. This latter is inher-
ently an emotion-generating activity. The architect is now
challenging the builder's way of doing the builder's job. For it to
be successful, the architect must
• remember that the builder has the inventive and creative re-
sponsibility for the implementation; so the architect suggests,
not dictates;
• always be prepared to suggest a way of implementing any-
thing he specifies, and be prepared to accept any other way
that meets the objectives as well;
• deal quietly and privately in such suggestions;
• be ready to forego credit for suggested improvements.

<div id="outline-container-5-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-2">Self-Discipline—The Second-System Effect</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">

<p>How does the architect avoid the second-system effect? Well,
obviously he can't skip his second system. But he can be conscious
of the peculiar hazards of that system, and exert extra self-disci-
pline to avoid functional ornamentation and to avoid extrapola-
tion of functions that are obviated by changes in assumptions and
purposes.
</p>
<p>
A discipline that will open an architect's eyes is to assign each
little function a value: capability x is worth not more than m bytes
of memory and n microseconds per invocation. These values will
guide initial decisions and serve during implementation as a guide
and warning to all.

<div id="outline-container-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1">Written Specifications—the Manual</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">

<p>I think the finest piece of manual writing I have ever seen is
Blaauw's Appendix to System/360 Principles of Operation. This de-
scribes with care and precision the limits of System/360 compati-
bility. It defines compatibility, prescribes what is to be achieved,
and enumerates those areas of external appearance where the ar-
chitecture is intentionally silent and where results from one model
may differ from those of another, where one copy of a given model
may differ from another copy, or where a copy may differ even
from itself after an engineering change. This is the level of preci-
sion to which manual writers aspire, and they must define what
is not prescribed as carefully as what is.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-2">Formal Definitions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">

<p>English, or any other human language, is not naturally a precision
instrument for such definitions. Therefore the manual writer must
strain himself and his language to achieve the precision needed.
An attractive alternative is to use a formal notation for such definitions. 
</p>
<p>
An ancient adage warns, "Never go to sea with two chronom-
eters; take one or three." The same thing clearly applies to prose
and formal definitions. If one has both, one must be the standard,
and the other must be a derivative description, clearly labeled as
such. Either can be the primary standard. Algol 68 has a formal
definition as standard and a prose definition as descriptive. PL/I
has the prose as standard and the formal description as derivative.
</p>
<p>
Many tools are available for formal definition. The Backus-
Naur Form is familiar for language definition, and it is amply
discussed in the literature.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The formal description of PL/I uses
new notions of abstract syntax, and it is adequately described.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
Iverson's APL has been used to describe machines, most notably
the IBM 7090<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> and System/360.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Bell and Newell have proposed new notations for describing
both configurations and machine architectures, and they have il-
lustrated these with several machines, including the DEC PDP-8,<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
the 7090<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.5.2" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>, and System/360.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
t is an implementation; it
runs. So all questions of definition can be resolved by testing it.
</p>
<p>
Using an implementation as a definition has some advantages.
All questions can be settled unambiguously by experiment. De-
bate is never needed, so answers are quick. Answers are always as
precise as one wants, and they are always correct, by definition.
</p>

<p>
The implementation as a definition overprescribed; it not only said what the machine must do, it also said a
great deal about how it had to do it.
</p>
<p>
Then, too, the implementation will sometimes give unex-
pected and unplanned answers when sharp questions are asked,
and the de facto definition will often be found to be inelegant in
these particulars precisely because they have never received any
thought. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, the use of an implementation as a formal definition is
peculiarly susceptible to confusion as to whether the prose de-
scription or the formal description is in fact the standard. This is
especially true of programmed simulations.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-3">

<p>It is especially useful
for establishing the syntax, if not the semantics, of intermodule
interfaces. This technique is to design the declaration of the passed
parameters or shared storage, and to require the implementations
to include that declaration via a compile-time operation (a macro
or a % INCLUDE in PL/I).

<p>A new problem
is usually discussed a while. The emphasis is on creativity, rather
than merely decision. The group attempts to invent many solu-
tions to problems, then a few solutions are passed to one or more
of the architects for detailing into precisely worded manual change
proposals.
</p>
<p>
The fruitfulness of these meetings springs from several
sources:
</p><ol>
<li>The same group—architects, users, and implementers—meets
</li>
</ol>

<p>weekly for months. No time is needed for bringing people up
to date.
</p><ol>
<li>The group is bright, resourceful, well versed in the issues, and
</li>
</ol>

<p>deeply involved in the outcome. No one has an "advisory"
role. Everyone is authorized to make binding commitments.
</p><ol>
<li>When problems are raised, solutions are sought both within
</li>
</ol>

<p>and outside the obvious boundaries.
</p><ol>
<li>The formality of written proposals focuses attention, forces
</li>
</ol>

<p>decision, and avoids committee-drafted inconsistencies.
</p><ol>
<li>The clear vesting of decision-making power in the chief archi-
</li>
</ol>

<p>tect avoids compromise and delay.
