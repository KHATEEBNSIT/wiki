* Chapter 1: Why Threads?

The threads model takes a process and divides it into two parts:	

+ One contains resources used across the whole program (the
  processwide information),such as program instructions and global
  data. This part is still referred to as the process.	

+ The other contains information related to the execution state, such
  as a program counter and a stack. This part is referred to as a
  /thread/.
