* Foreword
Our traffic with the subject matter of this book involves us with
three foci of phenomena: the human mind, collections of computer
programs, and the computer.

We call such programs algorithms, and a great deal is known of their optimal behavior, particularly
with respect to the two important parameters of execution time and data storage requirements. A
programmer should acquire good algorithms and idioms. Even though some programs resist precise
specifications, it is the responsibility of the programmer to estimate, and always to attempt to improve,
their performance.
