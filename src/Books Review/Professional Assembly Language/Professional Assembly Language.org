** Processor Instructions
The memory bytes that contain the instruction codes are no different
than the bytes that contain the data used by the processor.

To differentiate between data and instruction codes, special pointers
are used to help the processor keep track of where in memory the data
and instruction codes are stored.

** High-Level Languages
*** Types of high-level languages
they all can be classified into two
different categories, based on how they are run on the computer:
+ Compiled languages
+ Interpreted languages
