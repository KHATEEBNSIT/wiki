* Lib
** Python
+ [[http://www.scipy.org/][SciPy]]  is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for
  mathematics, science, and engineering. In particular,
+ [[https://code.google.com/p/scipy-cluster/][scipy-cluster]] An extension to Scipy for generating, visualizing, and
  analyzing hierarchical clusters.
+ [[http://orange.biolab.si/][orange]] Open source data visualization and analysis for novice and
  experts. Data mining through visual programming or Python scripting.
+ [[http://scikit-learn.org/][Scikit-learn]]: comprehensive and easy to use.
+ [[http://pybrain.org/][PyBrain]]: Neural networks are one thing that are missing from
  SciKit-learn, but this module makes up for it.
+ [[http://nltk.org/][nltk]]: really useful if you’re doing anything NLP or text mining
  related.
+ [[http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/][Theano]]: efficient computation of mathematical expressions using GPU.
  Excellent for deep learning.
+ [[http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/][Pylearn2]]: machine learning toolbox built on top of Theano - in very
  early stages of development.
+ [[http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/][MDP]] (Modular toolkit for Data Processing): a framework that is useful when setting up workflows.
+ [[https://code.google.com/p/java-statistical-analysis-tool/][JSAT]] stands for “Java Statistical Analysis Tool” - created by
  Edward Raff and was born out of his frustation with Weka. 


** Java
+ [[http://spark.apache.org/][Spark]] is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing,
  includes MLLib, which contains a good selection of machine learning
  algorithms, including classification, clustering and recommendation
  generation. Currently undergoing rapid development. Development can
  be in Python as well as JVM languages.
+ [[http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/][Weka]] is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining
  tasks.
+ [[https://mahout.apache.org/][Mahout]]: Apache’s machine learning framework built on top of Hadoop,
  this looks promising, but comes with all the baggage and overhead of
  Hadoop.
+ [[http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/][MALLET]] is a Java-based package for statistical natural language
  processing, document classification, clustering, topic modeling,
  information extraction, and other machine learning applications to
  text.


** C/C++
+ [[https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit][Vowpal Wabbit]]:  is the vowpal wabbit fast online learning code.
+ [[http://www.multiboost.org/][MultiBoost]] is a multi-class / multi-label / multi-task
  classification boosting software implemented in C++. 
+ [[http://image.diku.dk/shark/sphinx_pages/build/html/index.html][SHARK]] is a fast, modular, feature-rich open-source C++ machine
  learning library.
+ [[http://waffles.sourceforge.net/][Waffles]]: A machine learning toolkit.
+ [[http://dlib.net/][Dlib]] is a general purpose cross-platform C++ library designed using
  contract programming and modern C++ techniques.
+ [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/plearn/][PLearn]] is a C++ library aimed at research and development in the
  field of statistical machine learning algorithms.
+ [[http://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/][MLC++]] is a library of C++ classes for supervised machine learning. 
+ [[http://mlpack.org/][mlpack]] a scalable c++ machine learning library
+ [[http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/][LIBSVM]] A Library for Support Vector Machines. Both C++ and Java
  sources.
+ [[http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/][LibLinear]] A Library for Large Linear Classification
+ [[http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm][Cluster]] implement the most commonly used clustering methods for gene
  expression data analysis. 
+ [[http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/][SHOGUN]] is designed for unified large-scale learning for a broad
  range of feature types and learning settings, like classification,
  regression, or explorative data analysis.
** .NET
+ [[http://accord-framework.net/intro.html][Accord.NET]]: this seems to be pretty comprehensive, and comes
  recommended by [[http://www.reddit.com/user/primaryobjects][primaryobjects]] on Reddit.
+ use one of the Java libraries compiled to .NET using [[http://www.ikvm.net/][IKVM]].
