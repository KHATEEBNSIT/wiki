* configuration about the target
It is the number of coprocessors in the configuration. The TI816x has
several subsystems but no hardware accelerators. The TI816x(no STM,
ETB only) is the same as TI816x but does not have the System Trace
module (so it is compatible with emulators other than XDS560v2). The
TI816x_HWA is the most complete setup (however it uses more memory and
takes the longest time during debugging).
