* About book
Equally important is what we do not do in this book. We do not stress the
mathematical analysis of algorithms, leaving most of the analysis as informal arguments. You will not find a single theorem anywhere in this book. When more
details are needed, the reader should study the cited programs or
references. 

 Each chapter’s exercises will
contain links to 3-5 relevant “Programming Challenge” problems from
http://www.programming-challenges.com.
