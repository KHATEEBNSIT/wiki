* the schemetic is important
should read the datasheet carefully
address pins 

* auto converter chips
clean bus lines or will be problems

* sink source, voltage sink (ADC, DAC)
* how read a big project codes

** the abstract interface

** important data structures

* how design and debug a driver 
** read the datasheet
** know the kenalr API and things
** debug pintk and analysis
* bus speed 
* donot be afraid, maybe it is clear and simple
* draw some figures to help yourself understand
* Test codes or function, first think the processes, then do them 
then summarize 

* make the plan 
difficult 
* how to learn fast
* how to classify the knowledge and materials
